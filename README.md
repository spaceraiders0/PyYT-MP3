# PyYT-MP3

# Description
A little script I wrote that acts as a wrapper around acommand-line
utility called PyTube. It can take input from many sources, including
Playlists, text file(s), and direct video URLs, and optionally convert
them to MP3, or keep them as an MP4. 

# How To Use
Command descriptions and how to use this script coming soon.
