# PyYT-MP3
PyYT-MP3 is a script I wrote that acts as a wrapper around the Python module PyTube. It takes an Object Oriented
approach to handling the downloading of videos by allowing the use of individual "Downloader objects." These can be
given individual sets of URLs to be converted to their own individual file formats using FFmpeg.

# Motivations
There were a few reasons behind the making of this script. Mostly for my own purposes, but someone else might find
this useful at some point. <br/>
- Long video times are often now allowed by YouTube conversion sites
- It must be done through a website, which is often both closed source, and may contain suspicious components.
